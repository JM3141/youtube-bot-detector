# YouTube Bot Detector!

A Python project for detecting suspicious or automated activity on YouTube using API data and machine learning.

## User Stories
The following user stories describe the core goals of the project:
- As a user, I want to upload YouTube account activity data so the system can analyze it.
- As a user, I want to see which accounts are flagged as suspicious bots.
- As a user, I want to view metrics (comment frequency, posting ratios, text similarity) that explain why an account was flagged.
- As a user, I want to interact with a dashboard to explore suspicious activity patterns.
- As a user, I want confidence scores (e.g., “80% likely bot”) so I can judge reliability.
